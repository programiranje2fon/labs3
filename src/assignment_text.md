# Lab exercise 3

## Problem 1
(to be done by the tutor in cooperation with students)

Create the class **ComplexCalculator** in package **p1** with:

1. The method **divide** that takes two real numbers as its parameters, divides the first one by the second one, and returns the result.

2. The method **divide** that takes two integers as its parameters, divides the first one by the second one, and returns the result as an integer. 

3. The method **divideMod** that takes two integers as its parameters, and returns the remainder resulting from the division of the first number by the second. 

4. The method **print50times** that prints 50 times (on the console) the integer that it takes as a parameter. 

5. The method **printUpTo100** that prints on the screen numbers between 1 and 100. 

6. The static method **sum** that takes an integer parameter N i and calculates and returns the sum S(N) = 1+2+3+4+5+...+(N-1)+N. 

7. The static method **powerX** that takes a real number X and an integer N as its parameters and calculates and returns X to the power of N (N is a non-negative integer).

8. The static method **minPower2** that takes as its parameter an integer X and calculates and returns the smallest power of 2 that is greater than X. Example: given the input parameter 6, the method returns 8 (2 powered by 3) since it is the smallest power of 2 that is greater than 6. 

9. The static method **divideBy2** that takes an integer parameter, divides it by 2 as long as the number remains greater than 1, and prints the result on the screen after each division. Example: if the parameter value is 33, the method prints 16 (the result of the first division by 2), 8 (the result of the second division by 2), 4 (the result of the third division by 2), and 2 (the result of the fourth division by 2), 1 (the result of the last division by 2).

Create the **TestComplexCalculator** class in package **p1** that calls one static and one non-static method of ComplexCalculator. 


## Problem 2
(students work on it themselves)

Create the class **ComplexCalculator2** in package **p2** with:

1. The method **print55to0** that prints on the screen the numbers 0 to 55, but in the reversed order (55,54,53,52....1,0).

2. The static method **factorial** that takes an integer N as its parameter and calculates and returns its factorial:  N! = 1x2x...x(N-1)xN

3. The static method **ABN** that takes three integers - A, B and N - as its parameters and calculates and returns (A+B) to the power of N (N a non-negative number).

Create the class **TestComplexCalculator** in package **p2** that calls the static methods of ComplexCalculator2.
